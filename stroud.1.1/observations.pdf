1.) When I do a short number of processes like 1 or 2 the parent’s ID is always a large number, but starting 4 and up it eventually becomes 1. After running it sometimes after the parent being 1 the child ID would be 0 and the program would end. I also noticed that running 20+ processes results in this happening multiple times throughout the run time.

2.)(1) 1532790 ---> (2) 1532791 ---> (3) 1532792 ---> (4) 1532793

3.) The higher the process the more times the child gets adopted by init. It seems to happen more frequently in the beginning of the program and the end.

4.) Adding in the sleep function made a lot more children get adopted by init. It also changed the last child’s ID to -1 when it has normally been 0 for all the other runs.

5.) Running it causes the same process IDs to run but at different times with each iteration. This is also the same for parent and child ID. When I put a long sleep time it did not seem to finish running sometimes. Adding in the loop and sleep time has caused no children to be adopted by init each time I ran the program

6.) The wait function made the same process, parent and child run for the first few runs then changed to another one and would run that one for a little before switching again. It may have let the program get to 100 nprocs however after a certain amount of runs every time I ran the program it would seem to stop or slow down a lot. I don't think it can get to 100 processes. (This could also be an issue with my computer it does run extremely slow)

7.) Separating out the fprintf did not seem to have much difference on the program. I did notice that some output would take a little to display each line while at certain parts of the program it would output 2-3 lines extremely fast.

8.) The process ID starts at a higher number then increments down. I notice that it starts with the highest process ID from the first fprints before it goes in and reads characters.
